This is a simple cat directory app built with React Native, Redux and the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)

//TODO: Video demo in gif here

## Getting Started

These simple instructions will help you get this project up and running on your local machine and/or device for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built using your preferred package manager of choice (i.e npm or Yarn). By personal 
experience though, I would suggest Yarn for a quicker build experience.

### Installing

To download the project, kindly follow the instructions below:

```
git clone
https://github.com/firstChairCoder/Cat_ScratchBook_BackDrop.git
cd Cat_ScratchBook_BackDrop
```

Install dependencies and run with your preferred package manager:
For NPM:
```
npm install
npm start
```

For Yarn:
```
yarn
yarn start \\expo start works too since this was built using the Expo blank workflow
```

#### Fonts
* [SFPro Display Font]
(https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Pro.dmg) by [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).
This was further converted for optimal use on Windows and Android platforms by converting the font files from OpenType Font(OTF) to TrueType Font(TTF) using [Online Font Converter](https://onlinefontconverter.com/)

#### Images
All images not directly sourced from the Cat API were SVGs imported directly from the Figma file provided by BackDrop.
The conversion to a component was done using the [SVGR Playground](https://react-svgr.com/playground/?native=true) actively maintained by [Greg Bergé](https://github.com/gregberge/svgr)
Full acknowledgements must be given to the [Cat API]() and its maintainer(s).

Random fact: The repo name was inspired by CatScratch- an old cartoon about three cat brothers that inherited their wealthy owners fortune after she passed. An image from the Cat API reminded me of a character named Gordon Quid, for some reason. Quite the interesting subplot and it still holds up today with the catchy theme song and fun episodes
